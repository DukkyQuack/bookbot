# bookbot

BookBot is my first project!

Bookbot is a simple bot I made where you can insert any book you would like any the output will consist of:
- Total words found in the text
- How many times each leter appears

If you wish to add more books, simply add raw text to the /books directory and then run the line provided with the argument to the new book.
